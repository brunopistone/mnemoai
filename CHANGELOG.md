# Changelog

All notable changes to **Mnemo AI** (PyPI: `mnemoai-assistant`) are documented
here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and
the project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): until
1.0.0, minor versions may introduce features and occasional breaking changes;
from 1.0.0 on, breaking changes to the public surface (config keys, the
`mcp.json` schema, CLI commands, the package/CLI name) bump the major version.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.21] — 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **External MCP tools are now reachable on the `simple_qa` route.** A short
  factual question ("what time is in Singapore?") classifies as `simple_qa` —
  the no-tools route, which bound only the built-in meta tools (`memory`,
  `describe_image`, `fs_read`). External (`mcp.json`) tools were appended only to
  _non-empty_ routes, so a configured server like `time` was invisible on the
  very route such questions land in, and the model answered from its own
  knowledge ("I don't have access to the live clock") instead of calling the
  tool. External tools are user-configured capabilities, so they're now bound on
  **every** route, including `simple_qa`. (Built-in tool pruning per route is
  unchanged — only the handful of explicitly configured external tools ride
  along everywhere.)

- **Closed the last "stuck"-looking gap: the final answer after the last tool.**
  0.8.19 added a spinner _during_ tool execution, but the model call that turns
  the tool results into the final reply (`_call_model`) relied on the spinner
  being left running by the preceding tool node — which no longer held once each
  tool call stopped its own spinner on completion. The result was a blank pause
  between the last tool and the model's answer. `_call_model` now starts the
  spinner at entry itself (idempotent; stopped as soon as visible text/reasoning
  streams or the next tool starts), mirroring `_aggregate`, so the wait for the
  model's first token always shows progress.

## [0.8.19] — 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **No more "stuck"-looking terminal while a tool runs.** Previously the spinner
  stopped when a tool was about to execute and only restarted _after_ all tools
  finished, so a slow `tool.invoke()` (executing Python, a long shell command, a
  web fetch, a large file write) — especially right after the user confirmed it
  — showed a frozen, blank terminal with no sign of progress. The agent now
  animates a spinner with a per-tool label (e.g. `Running: python run.py`,
  `Searching the web`, `Writing /path/to/file`) for the full duration of each
  tool call, at both execution chokepoints (main loop and orchestrator worker
  loop). The spinner is always stopped afterward, even if the tool errors.

### Changed

- **Plan mode is now "read-only except…" rather than a blanket block.** While `/plan` is active:
  - **Read-only shell commands run.** `execute_bash` is allowed when the command
    is read-only (leading program in an allowlist — `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `rg`,
    `find`, `git status/log/diff/show`, etc. — with no redirection/chaining
    operators, and `git` limited to read-only subcommands). Mutating commands stay
    blocked. This lets the agent investigate properly while planning.
  - **The plan can be written to disk.** `fs_write`/`file_edit` are allowed only
    for a Markdown (`.md`) file under the plans directory (`paths.plans_dir()`),
    so the model can draft its plan incrementally. All other file writes remain
    blocked.
  - **The per-turn reminder is firmer.** ("Plan mode is active… you MUST NOT make any
    edits… this supersedes any other instructions"), points the model at the
    single writable plan file, and tells it to ask clarifying questions rather
    than guess.
  - Blocked-tool feedback is tailored per tool (read-only-bash hint; plan-file
    path hint) so the model pivots cleanly instead of just erroring.

## [0.8.17] — 2026-06-25

### Changed

- **Prompts moved out of `config.yaml` into a dedicated `prompts.yaml`.** All
  model-facing prompts — `SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `ROUTING_PROMPT`, `ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT`,
  `AGGREGATOR_PROMPT`, and the compaction prompts (`SUMMARY_SYSTEM_PROMPT`,
  `SUMMARY_TASK_PROMPT`, previously hardcoded in Python) — now live in a
  `prompts.yaml` sibling of `config.yaml` (same `config/` dir, same resolution +
  first-run seeding; `$MNEMOAI_PROMPTS` overrides). `config.yaml` now holds
  configuration only (~165 lines, down from ~400). Access is via
  `Config().prompt("KEY")`.

### Breaking

- Prompts are read **only** from `prompts.yaml` — never from `config.yaml`, and
  there are no in-code prompt fallbacks. Prompt keys left in `config.yaml` are
  ignored (a one-time migration warning is logged); move customizations to
  `prompts.yaml`. The app **fails fast at startup** (`PromptError`) if a required
  prompt is missing: the mandatory prompts (`SYSTEM_PROMPT`,
  `SUMMARY_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `SUMMARY_TASK_PROMPT`) are always required, and a
  feature's prompt is required when that feature is enabled (`ROUTING_PROMPT`
  with `ENABLE_ROUTING`; `ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT`/`AGGREGATOR_PROMPT` with
  `ENABLE_ORCHESTRATION`). A bundled `prompts.yaml` seeds new installs and
  provides the defaults, so out-of-the-box runs are unaffected.

## [0.8.16] — 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- Image and file questions no longer fail by routing to a tool subset that
  can't handle them. `describe_image` and `fs_read` are now always-available
  meta tools (bound on every route, like `memory`), so "what's in this image?"
  or "what's in config.yaml?" — which classify as `simple_qa`/`knowledge` — can
  always reach the vision/read tools instead of falling back to reading bytes
  as text.
- `fs_read` on a binary/image file now returns a clear message steering the
  model to `describe_image` (for images) instead of dumping a raw
  `UnicodeDecodeError` stack trace. Binary files are detected up front
  (extension + content sniff) and logged calmly.
- **Route table audit & repair.** The `knowledge` route named four reader tools
  that don't exist (`read_csv/json/pdf/docx` — `fs_read` handles all formats via
  its `mode`), and six tools (`list_background_tasks`, `cancel_background_task`,
  `clear_completed_tasks`, `get_plan_status`, `todo_clear`, `clear_documents`)
  were reachable only via `full`. Routes are now re-derived from the real tool
  surface: `code` binds the complete todo/plan/background-task suites; `knowledge`
  is scoped to the RAG index (`list_documents`/`search_in_documents`/
  `clear_documents`). A regression test guards against future orphans/stale refs.

### Changed

- The query router gained a deterministic heuristic fast-path: obvious queries
  (greetings → `simple_qa`, a lone file path → `code`, a URL → `research`, a doc
  extension → `knowledge`) route instantly with **no LLM classification call**,
  while multi-signal or ambiguous queries fall back to `full`/the LLM. This cuts
  a per-query round-trip, sidesteps the empty/blank-route issues on reasoning
  models, and — by always preferring `full` on mixed signals — never under-binds
  tools. The `knowledge` category in `ROUTING_PROMPT` is re-scoped to RAG
  document search (reading a file by path works from any category).

## [0.8.15] — 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- The "Thinking" spinner no longer stops too early on models that stream hidden
  reasoning. Some providers (e.g. Anthropic via Bedrock) send redacted/secret
  reasoning chunks before the answer; the spinner used to stop on the first such
  chunk, leaving a dead pause (spinner gone, nothing printed) until the visible
  answer arrived. The spinner now stops only when something is actually about to
  be displayed — visible answer text, or reasoning shown in verbose mode — and
  keeps spinning through hidden reasoning. The streaming callback likewise
  ignores empty/whitespace-only tokens.

### Fixed

- The interactive configurator (`/config`, `/model`, `/params`, first-run setup)
  now **re-asks on invalid input** instead of silently proceeding. Previously a
  bad menu choice kept the current value (or cancelled), and a non-numeric entry
  for `MAX_TOKENS` / `MAX_CONVERSATION_TOKENS` / the Mantle protocol was accepted
  or defaulted. Now menu prompts re-ask until a listed option is chosen, numeric
  prompts re-ask until the value parses as an int/float (`none` still clears
  optional `MAX_TOKENS`), and the `/model` and `/params` model pickers re-ask
  within the configured sections rather than cancelling on a wrong number.
- Streamed output no longer drops code at end-of-stream. The `CodeFormatter`'s
  `flush()` (now actually called when a stream ends) emits a response that ended
  inside an unclosed ` ``` ` fence, a held-back trailing backtick, and resets the
  terminal color after an unbalanced inline backtick — previously those were
  silently lost or left the prompt stuck in cyan. Bare `except:` clauses in the
  highlighter were also narrowed to `except Exception`.

### Changed

- Inline code / identifiers in streamed output are now **bold cyan** (matching
  Claude Code's look and the Rich default) instead of plain cyan, for a crisper
  distinction from surrounding prose. Fenced code blocks keep Pygments/monokai
  highlighting.

### Added

- A visible cancel affordance in the configurator: every interactive flow shows
  "Press Ctrl+C or Ctrl+D at any prompt to cancel — nothing is saved", and
  EOF/interrupt at any prompt now aborts cleanly (config left untouched) instead
  of half-applying an entry.

## [0.8.13] — 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- `/save` now writes to the profile's `conversations/` directory instead of the
  profile root (`~/.mnemoai/<profile>/`), where saved chats were cluttering the
  top level. New `paths.conversations_dir()` helper; existing files in the root
  are not moved (load them with an explicit `/load <path>`).

### Added

- `/save [path]` accepts an optional destination — a directory (saved there with
  the default `conversation_<ts>.json` name) or a full file path (`.json` added
  if missing). With no argument it saves to `conversations/` as before.
- `/load` with no argument now lists saved conversations (newest first, with
  relative times) and lets you pick one by number, instead of requiring a typed
  path. `/load <path>` still loads a specific file directly.

### Changed

- Compaction now shows phased progress on the spinner instead of a static
  "Generating summary …" line that looked frozen during the (single, long) LLM
  summary call. The spinner animates through `Summarizing N older messages` →
  `Applying summary` → the green "Compacted: …" result. (A true % bar isn't
  possible — one LLM generation has no measurable total — so this surfaces the
  discrete stages honestly rather than a fake bar.) The `Spinner` gained an
  optional `start(label=…)` argument and a `set_label()` method; the default
  label stays "Thinking" for the normal agent loop.

## [0.8.12] — 2026-06-24

### Changed

- The agent loop no longer hard-stops at 50 steps. That cap cut off legitimate
  long tasks mid-work with "Agent hit recursion limit". Following Claude Code's
  model — where context compaction, not a step count, is the real limiter — the
  default `LLM.RECURSION_LIMIT` is now **200** (still configurable). It remains a
  runaway guard (LangGraph requires a finite bound), so hitting it now signals a
  likely stuck loop and the message says so and points at the config knob.

### Fixed

- Log lines (warnings/errors/info) no longer print inline with streamed answer
  text. The chat UI streams chunks to stdout without a trailing newline, so a
  log written to stderr afterwards landed on the same visual line. A cursor
  tracker now records whether stdout is mid-line, and the log handler prepends a
  newline when needed — so logs always start on their own line (no-op on
  piped/non-TTY output).

## [0.8.11] — 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Compaction no longer corrupts the conversation by splitting a tool
  call/result pair. Previously the kept-verbatim window could start with an
  orphaned tool result (its originating assistant tool-call turn summarized
  away), which the OpenAI Responses API rejects on the very next turn with a
  deterministic 400 — "No tool call found for function call output with call_id
  …" — looping until the query fails. The split point is now tool-pair-safe
  (`_safe_tool_boundary`): it moves earlier as needed so a tool call and its
  result are always kept (or summarized) together.

### Changed

- Conversation compaction now uses Claude Code's compaction approach: a
  "summarizing conversations" system framing plus the verbatim structured task
  prompt (an `<analysis>` pass, then nine fixed sections — Primary Request,
  Key Technical Concepts, Files and Code Sections, Errors and fixes, Problem
  Solving, All user messages, Pending Tasks, Current Work, Optional Next Step).
  `/compact <focus>` is injected under a `## Compact Instructions` header; the
  `<analysis>` scratchpad is stripped from the result; and the injected summary
  block carries the verbatim continuation instruction so the model resumes the
  work seamlessly instead of recapping.

## [0.8.10] — 2026-06-23

### Added

- `REASONING_EFFORT` is now a first-class, `/params`-tunable knob for **every**
  provider that supports reasoning — `openai`, `anthropic`, `bedrock`, `mantle`,
  and `litellm` — translated to each provider's mechanism: forwarded as
  `reasoning_effort` on OpenAI and Mantle's `responses` protocol; mapped to a
  `thinking` token budget on Anthropic, standard Bedrock, and Mantle's
  `anthropic` protocol; passed through LiteLLM (which translates per backend).
  This gives Bedrock Mantle a real reasoning path it previously lacked. When
  thinking is enabled this way, `temperature`/`top_p`/`top_k` are dropped (the
  providers reject them).
- `EXTRA_PARAMS`: a generic per-model passthrough for the long tail. Any
  `MODEL_ID` / `VISION_MODEL_ID` may include an `EXTRA_PARAMS` dict whose
  contents are forwarded verbatim to the underlying model's request body (using
  the provider's own parameter names), so provider-specific knobs the curated
  registry doesn't model need no code change. Works for every provider (OpenAI,
  Anthropic, Bedrock, Ollama, SageMaker, LiteLLM, and all three Mantle
  protocols). `reasoning_effort` is lifted to a first-class arg on OpenAI-family
  clients; everything else merges into `model_kwargs`. A non-dict value is
  ignored. It is **config.yaml-only** — supported everywhere (never pruned by
  `/model`) but not prompted by `/model` or `/params`. `EXTRA_PARAMS` overrides
  the first-class `REASONING_EFFORT` if both set the same key.

### Changed

- `/params` only offers (and only writes) params the chosen provider actually
  supports — now covered by a regression test (e.g. Anthropic is never prompted
  for `PRESENCE_PENALTY`/`FREQUENCY_PENALTY`, but is for `REASONING_EFFORT`).

## [0.8.9] — 2026-06-23

### Changed

- The curated `MEMORY.md` now separates entries with a Markdown `---` rule
  instead of a `§` section sign, so the file renders as clean prose with
  dividers rather than showing a stray symbol. Existing `§`-delimited files are
  still read correctly and migrate to `---` automatically on the next memory
  write.

## [0.8.8] — 2026-06-22

### Changed

- `/clear` now wipes the terminal screen and scrollback and re-shows the welcome
  banner, for a true fresh start, instead of appending "Context cleared!" below
  the old conversation. No-op when stdout isn't a TTY (piped/redirected output
  stays clean).

## [0.8.7] — 2026-06-22

### Removed

- Reverted the streaming repetition-loop guard added in 0.8.6
  (`_is_degenerate_repetition`). Investigation confirmed the `<unused6226>`
  degeneration is a **non-deterministic serving-side issue** with
  `google.gemma-4-31b` on Bedrock Mantle (the identical request produces a clean
  answer on most calls and a repetition loop on a minority), not a client
  problem — so it belongs upstream, not as a heuristic in the stream loop. The
  guard added complexity and a regex scan on every chunk for a vendor bug that
  is being reported to AWS; removing it keeps the streaming path lean.

## [0.8.6] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- A runaway repetition loop no longer hangs the UI or burns the whole token
  budget. Some Bedrock Mantle-served models (observed with `google.gemma-4-31b`)
  intermittently degenerate into emitting a single reserved token
  (`<unused6226>`) until `MAX_TOKENS`, flooding the screen. The streaming loop
  now detects a special token repeated many times at the tail, aborts the
  stream early, and shows a clear message suggesting a different model or
  `API_PROTOCOL`. Conservative thresholds avoid tripping on legitimate
  repetition (lists, code, prose).

## [0.8.5] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- Arrow keys and backspace now work while typing answers in the `/config` and
  `/model` (and first-run) configurator prompts. They previously leaked raw
  escape sequences (e.g. `^[[D`) into the value because the `input()` prompts
  had no line editing; importing the stdlib `readline` module enables it.

## [0.8.4] — 2026-06-22

### Changed

- The answer marker (`●`) now precedes the answer on the **same line**
  (`● answer…`) instead of sitting on its own line above it, and it is also
  shown when reasoning is visible — printed after the gray reasoning block, on
  the answer line — so every assistant reply carries the marker.

## [0.8.3] — 2026-06-22

### Added

- A subtle cyan `●` marker is printed before a streamed answer when the model
  shows no reasoning, so the reply is visually distinct from the user's prompt
  instead of butting directly against it. Shown only on user-facing answer
  turns (main reply, retried answer, aggregated result) — worker streams already
  carry a `[Step N/N]` header.

## [0.8.2] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- The query classifier no longer crashes when no `ROUTING_PROMPT` is configured
  (e.g. a stripped config): `get_classifier_prompt()` now returns a built-in
  default instead of `None`, which previously raised a pydantic
  `ValidationError` while building the classification `SystemMessage`. This also
  fixes the unit suite running without a `config.yaml` (CI).

## [0.8.1] — 2026-06-22

### Changed

- `/model` now resets a section's inference parameters (temperature, top_p,
  penalties, reasoning, stop, stream — everything except the separately-prompted
  `MAX_TOKENS`) whenever the model is changed. These are model-specific, so a
  value tuned for one model is no longer silently carried into another that may
  reject it (e.g. newer Claude/GPT reject `temperature`); re-tune via `/params`.

### Fixed

- Reasoning models on the OpenAI Responses API (e.g. Bedrock Mantle Grok /
  GPT-5) no longer spam `Router returned unknown route '', falling back to
'full'` on every turn. The query classifier now disables reasoning on these
  models (`reasoning_effort="none"`) so the one-word route lands in the
  response instead of being eaten by reasoning, retries once on a transient
  empty response, and falls back to `full` quietly (debug, not a warning) when
  classification genuinely yields nothing.
- No more silent empty turn when a reasoning model is truncated by the
  output-token limit: if a turn ends with no answer and the response reports a
  token-limit cutoff (`status: incomplete` / `finish_reason: length` /
  `stop_reason: max_tokens`), the agent now surfaces a clear "increase
  `MAX_TOKENS`" message instead of an empty reply. Reasoning models spend output
  tokens reasoning before answering, so a low `MAX_TOKENS` could consume the
  whole budget before any answer was produced.
- Transient empty model responses are now retried. Some endpoints (notably
  Bedrock Mantle reasoning models on the Responses API) intermittently return a
  completely empty response — no content, reasoning, or tool call — for the same
  prompt that succeeds on a retry. Every model call (the main loop, orchestrator
  workers, and the aggregator) now retries an empty turn up to `LLM.MAX_RETRIES`
  times. This fixes blank `[Step N/N: …]` turns seen under orchestration.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-06-22

### Removed

- The `/good` command and its conversation "quality marker" plumbing. The
  markers were written into saved-conversation JSON but never consumed (no
  training/export pipeline existed), so the feature over-promised. `/save` now
  writes a plain conversation file. (Removing a command pre-1.0; noted here so
  it isn't a surprise.)

### Added

- CI: a `tests` GitHub Actions workflow runs the unit suite (and an import-sort
  check) on every push/PR across Python 3.11-3.13.
- This `CHANGELOG.md`, plus a documented Stability & Versioning contract and a
  release checklist (see `docs/development.md`).
- Expanded the integration tier: plan-mode enforcement (deterministic — asserts
  the file write is blocked) and the bash-timeout regression run end-to-end.

### Fixed

- No more silent empty turns: when the model ends a turn with no visible text
  right after a tool ran (e.g. a bash timeout) and produced no reasoning either,
  the agent now salvages the last tool result (or a fallback message) instead of
  returning an empty string.
- Streaming errors no longer lose the turn: on a mid-stream failure the agent
  now retries once non-streaming and prefers that complete result, instead of
  keeping a truncated partial chunk.
- Integration tests are provider-aware: they no longer falsely skip with
  "Ollama not reachable" when the configured model is a cloud provider
  (Bedrock/Mantle/OpenAI/Anthropic/SageMaker/LiteLLM). Verified end-to-end
  against Bedrock (Claude Sonnet).
- Welcome box auto-sizes to its widest command row instead of a hardcoded
  width, so longer command descriptions (e.g. `/plan`) no longer overflow the
  border.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Enforced plan mode (`/plan`).** A user-toggled, read-only mode that
  hard-blocks mutating/exec tools (`execute_bash`, `fs_write`, `file_edit`,
  git writes, background tasks) client-side until you exit — so "analyze the
  repo" can never turn into edits, regardless of the model. Read-only tools and
  the memory notebook stay allowed. Distinct from the advisory `plan_mode.py`
  bookkeeping tools.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-06-19

### Changed

- Refreshed the PyPI project description after the README was split into a
  MkDocs site; re-exported the demo GIF smaller.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Curated persistent memory (`MEMORY.md`).** A small, bounded, profile-scoped
  markdown file the agent maintains itself via a `memory` tool
  (`add`/`replace`/`remove`), injected whole into the system prompt at session
  start. Char-capped (forces consolidation); complements episodic memory and the
  ACE playbook. `ENABLE_MEMORY` / `REQUIRE_MEMORY_CONFIRMATION` toggles; `/memory`
  command. The `memory` tool is bound on every route (incl. `simple_qa`).
- Documentation split into a MkDocs Material site published to GitHub Pages.

## [0.5.2] — 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- Logger output is colored by level (errors red, warnings yellow) on a TTY;
  redirected/piped logs stay plain.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- Repair a common malformed tool-args shape from smaller models
  (`{'query="…"': ''}` → `{'query': '…'}`) before validation, so the call
  succeeds instead of failing the turn.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Hard confirmation gate** for destructive tools: `execute_bash`
  (`REQUIRE_BASH_CONFIRMATION`) and `fs_write`/`file_edit`
  (`REQUIRE_WRITE_CONFIRMATION`), both default on. Enforced client-side; the
  prompt always fires regardless of the model. Non-interactive runs auto-proceed.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-19

### Added

- **External MCP servers** via `~/.mnemoai/mcp/mcp.json` (Claude Code/kiro
  `mcpServers` schema). Tools from external servers are merged with the built-in
  server; colliding names are namespaced `servername__tool`. `/mcp` lists them.
- Orchestrator awareness of external tools (routes subtasks needing them to the
  `full` category).
- App-home reorganized into `config/` and `mcp/` subfolders, each seeded with
  example templates on first run (legacy flat paths still read).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Direct Anthropic API provider** (`TYPE: anthropic`) for chat and vision via
  `langchain-anthropic` — distinct from the Bedrock Mantle `anthropic` protocol.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-06-19

### Added

- A gray `[⚙ tool(args)]` marker between reasoning blocks so tool calls are
  visible after MCP request logs were silenced.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-19

### Added

- `/params` command to tune a model's inference parameters interactively.
- Numbered provider-type menu in `/model` (Mantle shown as `bedrock-mantle`).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06

### Added

- Initial public release on PyPI as `mnemoai-assistant`.
- Local agentic assistant on LangGraph + MCP: StateGraph agent (classify →
  route/orchestrate → call model ↔ execute tools), multi-provider LLM support
  (Ollama, Amazon Bedrock, Bedrock Mantle, OpenAI, SageMaker, LiteLLM), episodic
  memory, ACE playbook, user-profile learning, RAG, web search/crawl, vision,
  and a `prompt_toolkit` chat UI with `/config` / `/model` configurators.
